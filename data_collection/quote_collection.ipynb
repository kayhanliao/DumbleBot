Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime.  \n",

Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.  Harry is left alone in the room.

I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round.   DUMBLEDORE: (To the contestants) In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way. \n",

Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she is attacked and knocked down.

He looks at Trelawney, who stands alone in the entry hall, smiling at Dumbledore through her tears.  DUMBLEDORE: ...You cannot send them from this castle. That is still my decision. Professor Trelawney will remain here.  Umbridge turns to him, furious. \n",

Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange glances. DUMBLEDORE: Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-— At this, UMBRIDGE stands and clears her throat.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  Our explanation begins with your scar. You already know that it is a connection between you and Voldemort, and that this connection goes both ways.  (pause)\n",

      "DUMBLEDORE: \n",

      "DUMBLEDORE:  If the Dementors are taking their orders from the Ministry exclusively, then it must certainly follow logically that someone in the Ministry ordered the attack.  (pause ) And in that case, I'm sure the Ministry will make a full inquiry. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: On the contrary, Cornelius. If they were there, then Harry was acting in self-defense, which is perfectly allowable under Clause Seven of the Decree of Reasonable Restriction of Underaged Wizardry. (pause ) We are all in agreement on this? \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  Harry turns in his seat.  Dumbledore stands by the door of the COURTROOM, looking up at the Minister. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: He didn’t hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated. \n",

      "DUMBLEDORE: Thank you...  He takes a small baby Phoenix from his pocket and places it on Fawkes’ stand.  Dumbledore’s desk has been repaired, and the Pensive rests upon it.  DUMBLEDORE: Please sit, Harry.  Harry is staring at him, bitterness and sorrow evident on his face.  DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.  Harry nearly snarls at him.  DUMBLEDORE: There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength... \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: What can’t I know?  187.  Harry grabs an instrument from one of the tables and throws  it across the room.  DUMBLEDORE: This pain is part of being human, Harry... \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt’s house your home, you are protected.  Harry looks away.  DUMBLEDORE: And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.  Harry stares into his blue eyes.  DUMBLEDORE: Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?  Harry nods. DUMBLEDORE:  Do you remember what you asked me that night? \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Excellent.  Dumbledore gets out of his chair, vanishes it with the wave of a wand, and sweeps from the COURTROOM.  Harry gets out of the wooden chair, glances upward at Umbridge.  Their eyes meet for a split second. She glowers at him. Harry exits.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: conjures up a SQUASHY, CHINTZ armchair next to Harry's and sits down with a mild squeak.  He steeples his fingers and looks up at the Minister with an expression of polite interest. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!  Fudge looks cowed.  DUMBLEDORE: If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.  No one looks remotely interested in trying to arrest Dumbledore. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school. (pause ) Also, she will probably need medical attention, having had a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening. (pause )\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  It appears that when Sirius told him to get out, Kreacher thought he meant out of the house. So he went to the Black’s closest relatives, the Malfoys.  (pause) Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius had forbidden him from giving up important secrets. But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship with you.  (pause) He told them how you saw him as a mixture of father and brother, and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius.  (pause) Voldemort knew that making you believe he had Sirius in the Department of Mysteries would force you there. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.  Harry glares at the carpet.  DUMBLEDORE: During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.  (pause)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Harry!  He runs to Harry’s side and touches his skin. He closes his eyes and whispers a spell. Harry’s eyes snap open.  DUMBLEDORE: Are you all right, Harry?  Harry nods, dazed. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended.  Fudge points at Dumbledore. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  Actually, we have a witness to the presence of the Dementors in question. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made just before your birth. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the terms of the prophesy. Voldemort’s mistake was that he had not heard the entire prophesy.  (pause) That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you.  Harry sighs this time. He looks at the floor.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.  Dumbledore raises his wand to his temple and extracts a memory, placing it in the pensive. He waves his wand over it.  The ghostly image of Professor Trelawney rises from the bowl. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  It means that the only person with a chance of defeating Voldemort was born at the end of July to parents who had resisted him three times before. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You should not have come here tonight, Tom. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  This power drove you to save Sirius tonight. It kept Voldemort from possessing you, he cannot bear to touch it.  (pause ) In the end, it was your heart and not your head that saved you.  Harry looks away.  DUMBLEDORE: There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states “neither can live while the other survives.”  Harry slowly looks up at Dumbledore. DUMBLEDORE: It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes.  They sit quietly together. Dumbledore softly wipes a tear from his cheek. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Stay where you are, Harry!  Dumbledore sounds frightened.  Then Harry SCREAMS. His scar simply SPLITS open and BLOOD\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.  Voldemort fires another killing curse at Dumbledore. Fawkes the Phoeniz swoops down from above and SWALLOWS the jet of green light, EXPLODING into flames and falling to the earth.  Dumbledore spins, sending a constant flow of BLINDING LIGHT\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  You forget the next qualification of the prophesy. The Dark Lord will mark this boy as his equal.  (pause) In giving you that scar, Voldemort did so. I’m afraid that the prophesy is most certainly referring to you. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE:  He chose the child he believed to be the more dangerous. He chose the “half-blood” wizard because he saw some of himself in you.  (pause ) He tried to kill you and instead gave you the power and the future to destroy him. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn’t know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.  He motions for all of them to sit. They sit. Dumbledore moves to Fawkes.  DUMBLEDORE: Fawkes, we will need a warning.  The PHOENIX vanishes in a blast of fire.  Dumbledore sits back at his desk and pulls a SILVERY,\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Naturally, naturally. (pause) But in essence divided?  Harry and Ron exchange confused looks. Everard returns to his portrait.  DUMBLEDORE: What news? \n",

      "DUMBLEDORE: It’s fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you.  He grips Harry’s shoulder. DUMBLEDORE: Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring. DUMBLEDORE: Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.  They do so. He moves to Fawkes.  Fudge opens his eyes. Dumbledore grabs onto Fawkes’ tail, and the two VANISH in a BLAST of FIRE. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Professor McGonagall, and...ah...  Dumbledore does not look at Harry, even acknowledge his presence.  DUMBLEDORE: What can I do for you? \n",

      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.  She nods and departs. Dumbledore again turns to the portraits hanging on the wall.  DUMBLEDORE: Phineas. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: “Portus.”  McGonagall returns with Ginny, Fred, and George in tow. \n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I’m afraid I shall have to hurt you.  In one motion, all of them draw their wands. Harry dives for cover.  Dumbledore is fastest. There is an instant of BLINDING LIGHT as spells blast in all directions. A spell strikes Dumbledore’s desk with a BANG, and explodes. Dust fills the room.  There is a shout and some SCUFFLING OF FEET, another BANG, and silence.  Harry blinks and stands as the dust settles. Dumbledore hasn’t moved. Fudge, the Auror, Dolores, Kingsley, and Percy are all laying on the floor, unconscious.  Dumbledore’s desk has been broken in half, and all of the tables overturned.  He moves swiftly to McGonagall, Harry, and Marietta.  DUMBLEDORE: Are you all right?  McGonagall is standing, dusting herself off. \n",

      "DUMBLEDORE: She will not be leaving. Behind Umbridge, the crowd parts slowly, and Dumbledore moves down the steps.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However... He looks at Trelawney, who stands alone in the entry hall, smiling at Dumbledore through her tears. DUMBLEDORE: ...You cannot send them from this castle. That is still my decision. Professor Trelawney will remain here. Umbridge turns to him, furious.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor for good Professor Trelawney already. As you know... Umbridge is looking mutinous. DUMBLEDORE: ...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D) .--which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door. Harry grins at Fred and George. DUMBLEDORE: Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange glances. DUMBLEDORE: Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-— At this, UMBRIDGE stands and clears her throat.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Our explanation begins with your scar. You already know that it is a connection between you and Voldemort, and that this connection goes both ways. (pause)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Haven’t you wondered why I haven’t spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: No. Harry draws his wand, looking furious.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It is my fault Sirius died tonight. (pause )\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: If the Dementors are taking their orders from the Ministry exclusively, then it must certainly follow logically that someone in the Ministry ordered the attack. (pause ) And in that case, I'm sure the Ministry will make a full inquiry.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: On the contrary, Cornelius. If they were there, then Harry was acting in self-defense, which is perfectly allowable under Clause Seven of the Decree of Reasonable Restriction of Underaged Wizardry. (pause ) We are all in agreement on this?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Harry turns in his seat. Dumbledore stands by the door of the COURTROOM, looking up at the Minister.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: He didn’t hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It is time to tell you what I should have five years ago. No doubt you have wondered why it was that I sent you there and not to a wizarding family? (pause)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work. Fudge is sputtering incomprehensibly. DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Portus. He motions Harry over.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: The Second War has begun, Minister. Harry takes the head with Dumbledore, and they vanish from the Ministry of Magic.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Thank you... He takes a small baby Phoenix from his pocket and places it on Fawkes’ stand. Dumbledore’s desk has been repaired, and the Pensive rests upon it. DUMBLEDORE: Please sit, Harry. Harry is staring at him, bitterness and sorrow evident on his face. DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry. Harry nearly snarls at him. DUMBLEDORE: There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: What can’t I know? 187. Harry grabs an instrument from one of the tables and throws it across the room. DUMBLEDORE: This pain is part of being human, Harry...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt’s house your home, you are protected. Harry looks away. DUMBLEDORE: And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders. Harry stares into his blue eyes. DUMBLEDORE: Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort? Harry nods. DUMBLEDORE: Do you remember what you asked me that night?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Excellent. Dumbledore gets out of his chair, vanishes it with the wave of a wand, and sweeps from the COURTROOM. Harry gets out of the wooden chair, glances upward at Umbridge. Their eyes meet for a split second. She glowers at him. Harry exits.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: conjures up a SQUASHY, CHINTZ armchair next to Harry's and sits down with a mild squeak. He steeples his fingers and looks up at the Minister with an expression of polite interest.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses! Fudge looks cowed. DUMBLEDORE: If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be. No one looks remotely interested in trying to arrest Dumbledore.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school. (pause ) Also, she will probably need medical attention, having had a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening. (pause )\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (cont'd) Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It appears that when Sirius told him to get out, Kreacher thought he meant out of the house. So he went to the Black’s closest relatives, the Malfoys. (pause) Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius had forbidden him from giving up important secrets. But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship with you. (pause) He told them how you saw him as a mixture of father and brother, and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius. (pause) Voldemort knew that making you believe he had Sirius in the Department of Mysteries would force you there.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed. Harry glares at the carpet. DUMBLEDORE: During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams. (pause)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Harry! He runs to Harry’s side and touches his skin. He closes his eyes and whispers a spell. Harry’s eyes snap open. DUMBLEDORE: Are you all right, Harry? Harry nods, dazed.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended. Fudge points at Dumbledore.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Actually, we have a witness to the presence of the Dementors in question.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made just before your birth. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the terms of the prophesy. Voldemort’s mistake was that he had not heard the entire prophesy. (pause) That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you. Harry sighs this time. He looks at the floor.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved. Dumbledore raises his wand to his temple and extracts a memory, placing it in the pensive. He waves his wand over it. The ghostly image of Professor Trelawney rises from the bowl.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It means that the only person with a chance of defeating Voldemort was born at the end of July to parents who had resisted him three times before.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You should not have come here tonight, Tom.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: This power drove you to save Sirius tonight. It kept Voldemort from possessing you, he cannot bear to touch it. (pause ) In the end, it was your heart and not your head that saved you. Harry looks away. DUMBLEDORE: There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states “neither can live while the other survives.” Harry slowly looks up at Dumbledore. DUMBLEDORE: It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes. They sit quietly together. Dumbledore softly wipes a tear from his cheek.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Stay where you are, Harry! Dumbledore sounds frightened. Then Harry SCREAMS. His scar simply SPLITS open and BLOOD\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been. Voldemort fires another killing curse at Dumbledore. Fawkes the Phoeniz swoops down from above and SWALLOWS the jet of green light, EXPLODING into flames and falling to the earth. Dumbledore spins, sending a constant flow of BLINDING LIGHT\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You forget the next qualification of the prophesy. The Dark Lord will mark this boy as his equal. (pause) In giving you that scar, Voldemort did so. I’m afraid that the prophesy is most certainly referring to you.\n",

(a droll whisper) Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One. Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized. DUMBLEDORE: So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Take matters into their own hands? Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you? Mind?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: That was fun. May I use the loo? As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns. Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Indeed they are.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That is why he is returning to Hogwarts. And it is crucial he return... Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the moon. DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Both are waiting for you. Dumbledore extends his arm. Mystified, Harry reaches out. As his fingers touch the silk of Dumbledore’s cloak, he...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master. Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape. This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns, then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First Years. DUMBLEDORE: Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight. You have a right to know why.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Today, of course, the world knows him by another name. Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact. Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle. But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you. Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of attention. DUMBLEDORE: Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed. Pip pip!\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit. Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously. Sits. DUMBLEDORE: So. How are you?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Enjoying your classes? Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Do you?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: And what of your activities outside the classroom? Do they bring you satisfaction?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Forgive me, Harry, I...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: ... I was merely curious. (rising) In any event, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers. DUMBLEDORE: What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle. Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age. DUMBLEDORE: This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would... Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises, gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking the surface...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps you could give me an example. Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing, depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: How do you do, Tom. Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: As you wish. Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time, notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, and\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: No. I am a Professor.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps they’re right.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Riddle looks up, cocks his head ever-so-slightly. DUMBLEDORE: It’s a school. A school of... magic. Riddle stays looking, but says nothing. DUMBLEDORE: You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t. Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: I’m like you, Tom. Different. Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Take it out. As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE -- the only sound in the now-silent room. DUMBLEDORE: Is there anything in that box you ought not to have? Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE, and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN. DUMBLEDORE: Why did you want these things, Tom?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? (as Riddle nods) I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave your window open tonight. An owl will bring you a message. Read it carefully. Dumbledore starts to exit, when:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It is unusual. But not unheard of. Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving 11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time? No. Had I... Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle’s fragmented face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore. DUMBLEDORE: Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess which teacher that might be?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: No. I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... (eyeing Harry knowingly) I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry. But I promise. In time you will know everything.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s also a lie. (off Harry’s look) This memory has been tampered with. In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Why indeed. Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve. DUMBLEDORE:\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins. Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies them. They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole. DUMBLEDORE: This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore’s hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Why indeed. Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: To whom might I ask?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended. As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she indicates Ron and Hermione.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: How is he? Horace? Harry shrugs. Dumbledore nods, then tips his hand. A\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (haunted) This is beyond anything I imagined. In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific. I know now... you will see worse. Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Oh he succeeded. And not just once. Think, Harry. He’s just told us.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: They can be anything. The most commonplace of objects. A ring, for example. Or a book... Dumbledore slides open a drawer, removes the RING and Tom Riddle’s battered DIARY.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this -- (holding up the diary)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and... (raising his damaged hand) ... even more difficult to destroy.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: One destroys Voldemort. Harry begins to reach out for the ring...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: True. But magic, especially Dark magic...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: ... leaves traces. Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face. Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow “see” into Harry’s heart. Trepidation -- and recognition -- flicker over his face.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Harry peers into Dumbledore’s eyes. Dumbledore nods. DUMBLEDORE: Once again, I shall ask too much of you.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant. I will not negotiate this with you, Severus. You agreed. There’s nothing more to discuss. Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his back. Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can react -- is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier. Dumbledore turns. Smiles. DUMBLEDORE: Harry. You need a shave, my friend. Harry runs his hand over his face. DUMBLEDORE: At times I forget how much you’ve grown. At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. (smiling) Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I am an old man.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry. I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise. But there is a condition: You must obey any command I give you -- without question.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide. Harry nods. * DUMBLEDORE: Should I tell you to run, you will * run. Harry nods. * DUMBLEDORE: And should I tell you to abandon * me and save yourself... Harry’s eyes rise, meet Dumbledore’s. * DUMBLEDORE: * You will do so. * Harry hesitates. DUMBLEDORE: Your word, Harry. Harry debates this internally, then, finally, nods. *\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Take my arm.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Being me has its privileges. The WIND GUSTS and Harry reaches out. Dumbledore’s CLOAK\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: This is the place. Oh yes, this place has known magic. (closing his eyes) Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty... Dumbledore’s wand stops briefly in its arc and his face registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry. He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the rock. DUMBLEDORE: One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear. But this much is known: the children were damaged. Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his fingers play over the rock... then stop. His eyes open. He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet beads.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much more precious than mine.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Careful. The water. Harry peers into the lake. It is black as ink.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It’s there. The only question is how do we get to it?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps not.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: If you would, Harry... Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Only recreationally. You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck. Harry looks down into the water, watches a FACE skim by beneath the surface.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Yes.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Remember... the water. Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at the source of the GLOW -- a BASIN filled with a\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Oh yes. Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin. Notes the\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: It has to be drunk. (as Harry reacts) You remember the condition on which I brought you with me?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: This potion might paralyze me. It might cause me to forget why I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests, Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. (taking the goblet) Your good health, Harry. Dumbledore dips the goblet into the gleaming liquid and brings it to his lips. Drinks deep. Closes his eyes.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Don’t... don’t make me... Harry eyes Dumbledore’s anguished face, steels himself.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Nooooooo!!!\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Make it stop... Please... make it stop...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: My fault. It’s all my fault... Harry brings the goblet up once more. Dumbledore drinks. DUMBLEDORE: Too much... I can’t... take it...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Your word, Harry! Your word!\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Water.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Water...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Water! Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it to Dumbledore’s lips... but once again finds it empty. Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Go... Harry turns, confused. Dumbledore’s hand finds his face. DUMBLEDORE: We have to... go. Harry glances to the boat. Flames lick the prow, darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: No. Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (smiling faintly) No, Harry. I do not pray. I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate. Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head, listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his infirmity. DUMBLEDORE: Hide yourself below. And do not speak or show yourself without my permission. No matter what. Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER. DUMBLEDORE: Do as I say, Harry. Harry hesitates. Dumbledore’s eyes blaze... DUMBLEDORE: Trust me. Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below, the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW. DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer? Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You are not an assassin, Draco.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison. Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I’m curious. When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Then I shall make it easy for you. Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand. * Instantly Malfoy raises his own. *\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Well done, Draco. But I warn you. * Killing is not nearly as easy. *\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How?\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: That cabinet has been broken for years.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Ingenious. Let me guess. It has a sister. A twin.\n",
      "DUMBLEDORE: Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time. Draco looks deep into Dumbledore’s eyes. His hand trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows. Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND... when FOOTSTEPS\n",
