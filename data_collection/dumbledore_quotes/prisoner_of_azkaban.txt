DUMBLEDORE: Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. I myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair...
DUMBLEDORE: Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor.
DUMBLEDORE: As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!
DUMBLEDORE: (turning grave)
DUMBLEDORE: The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. While they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities. Under no circumstances are you to approach them. It is not in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving.
DUMBLEDORE: Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.
DUMBLEDORE: Dear lady. Who did this to you?
DUMBLEDORE: Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you... to the Great Hall.
DUMBLEDORE: (nodding)
DUMBLEDORE: I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped Sirius Black enter it, Severus.
DUMBLEDORE: No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing to let the students return to their Houses. But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep...
DUMBLEDORE: It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to rest.
DUMBLEDORE: Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor Tower tonight?
DUMBLEDORE: Scabbers...?
DUMBLEDORE: I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
DUMBLEDORE: Ah... a shooting star. If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the time. But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem...
DUMBLEDORE: Mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
DUMBLEDORE: By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.
DUMBLEDORE: (O.S.) Excuse me, Minister. I believe I must sign as well...
DUMBLEDORE: Professor Dippet had those blackberries planted when he was Headmaster...
DUMBLEDORE: (a hint of amusement)
DUMBLEDORE: I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do with it, Hagrid. How could you? You've been with us all along.
DUMBLEDORE: Search the skies if you must, Minister. In the meantime, I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea, Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.
DUMBLEDORE: By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.
DUMBLEDORE: Well?
DUMBLEDORE: Did what?
