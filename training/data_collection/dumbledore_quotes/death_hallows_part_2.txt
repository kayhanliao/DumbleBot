DUMBLEDORE: That wasn’t my intention. Snape stares fearfully at him. DUMBLEDORE: Stand up, Severus. I haven’t much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?
DUMBLEDORE: Is this about the Prophecy?
DUMBLEDORE: How much did you relay?
DUMBLEDORE: The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
DUMBLEDORE: If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.
DUMBLEDORE: You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
DUMBLEDORE: And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?
DUMBLEDORE: Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus. Snape reels, staring miserably at the SLATE SKY beyond the windows. Dumbledore studies him cunningly. DUMBLEDORE: The boy survives. Snape’s eyes shift. Regard Dumbledore. DUMBLEDORE: He has her eyes.
DUMBLEDORE: If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then your way is clear. 
DUMBLEDORE: The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does. Snape stares once more at the sky beyond. Then, softly:
DUMBLEDORE: My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist. Snape continues to stare at the sky. We DRIFT TO it. It
DUMBLEDORE: Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.
DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps. Oh. Severus. (as he stops) Keep an eye on Professor Quirrell, won’t you? 
DUMBLEDORE: For the time being?
DUMBLEDORE: How long?
DUMBLEDORE: Well, this makes matters much more straightforward. Snape studies Dumbledore briefly, looks away. DUMBLEDORE: Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort’s plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?
DUMBLEDORE: But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn to... you. 
DUMBLEDORE: You must agree. Snape stares in horror at Dumbledore. Dumbledore nods. DUMBLEDORE: Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
DUMBLEDORE: (thundering) Too much! Nothing I could ask is too much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone! Snape says nothing. Dumbledore sits back, painfully studies his hand. DUMBLEDORE: There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
DUMBLEDORE: On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort’s soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself. Snape stares in disbelief. Dumbledore nods. DUMBLEDORE: There’s a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There’s a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort’s mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential. Snape nods, pondering all of this. His voice is bitter.
DUMBLEDORE: But this is touching, Severus. Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care for the boy? Snape eyes Dumbledore fiercely, then:
DUMBLEDORE: Lily. After all this time?
DUMBLEDORE: (V.O.) The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
DUMBLEDORE: You cannot help. Harry spins, finds Dumbledore standing within the mist. At the sight of Harry, Dumbledore beams and spreads his arms wide. His hand is whole, no longer damaged. DUMBLEDORE: Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, yes.
DUMBLEDORE: Ah. That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole I think not.
DUMBLEDORE: Not. 
DUMBLEDORE: And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE: Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself. Harry plays his fingers over his sternum. DUMBLEDORE: You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make.
DUMBLEDORE: Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess. Dumbledore smiles. Harry ponders this, then, deep in the mist, the THUMPING returns.
DUMBLEDORE: Something beyond either of our help. Harry ponders his surroundings.
DUMBLEDORE: King’s Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.
DUMBLEDORE: You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn’t trust you.
DUMBLEDORE: You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes.
DUMBLEDORE: True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
DUMBLEDORE: (looking him in the eye) You are the true master of death, Harry, because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world.
DUMBLEDORE: That is up to you.
DUMBLEDORE: Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let’s say, board a train.
DUMBLEDORE: On. Harry nods.
DUMBLEDORE: True.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes.
DUMBLEDORE: Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’ Harry glances at him. 
DUMBLEDORE: I’ve never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon. 
DUMBLEDORE: Luck.
DUMBLEDORE: Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.
DUMBLEDORE: Actually, if I think about it... it doesn’t seem curious at all. (a smile) I’ll be going now, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE: Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?
