DUMBLEDORE: ...They are not.  
DUMBLEDORE: I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a  few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor  McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.  
DUMBLEDORE: Argus! Argus, I... Everyone will proceed to their dormitories  immediately. Everyone except... you three.  
DUMBLEDORE: She’s not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.  
DUMBLEDORE: But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say... 
DUMBLEDORE: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.  
DUMBLEDORE: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame  Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be  made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend  caution... to all. 
DUMBLEDORE: There’s been another attack.  
DUMBLEDORE: It means...that our students are in great danger.  
DUMBLEDORE: The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we  feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.  
DUMBLEDORE: Harry?  
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, and about time, too. He’s been looking dreadful for days.  Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They  burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn  from the ashes.  
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely  heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers.  
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid-  
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.  
DUMBLEDORE: Yes.  
DUMBLEDORE: No, Harry. I do not think it was you... But I must ask you, is  there something you wish to tell me?     
DUMBLEDORE: Very well, then. Off you go.  
DUMBLEDORE: Riddle! Come.  
DUMBLEDORE: It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.  
DUMBLEDORE: I’m afraid they are, Tom. They are true.  
DUMBLEDORE: I understand Tom, but I’m afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no  choice.     
DUMBLEDORE: Is there something you wish to tell me?  
DUMBLEDORE: Very well, then. Off you go.  
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?     
DUMBLEDORE: I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full  confidence.  
DUMBLEDORE: Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?  
DUMBLEDORE: Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I  will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be  given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.  
DUMBLEDORE: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have  broken perhaps a dozen school rules?  
DUMBLEDORE: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.  
DUMBLEDORE: Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special  Awards for Services to the School.  
DUMBLEDORE: And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these  release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back.  Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real  loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to  you. And, um... second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right,  Harry?  
DUMBLEDORE: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord  Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I’m not mistaken, Harry, he transferred  some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.  
DUMBLEDORE: Not intentionally, but yes.  
DUMBLEDORE: It’s true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that  Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say  so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you  in Gryffindor?  
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from  Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our  choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that  you look more closely at this. Be careful.  
DUMBLEDORE: Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. 
DUMBLEDORE: When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley’s daughter was  taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.  
DUMBLEDORE: Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that  you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the  first place.  
DUMBLEDORE: I beg your pardon?     
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, yes.  
DUMBLEDORE: Voldemort.  
DUMBLEDORE: Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means  of this.  
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that  no more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things should find their way into  innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.  
DUMBLEDORE: Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for  Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so  successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of  the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled.
