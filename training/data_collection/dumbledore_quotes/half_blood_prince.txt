DUMBLEDORE: amidst a MOB of REPORTERS. CAMERAS FLASH. Dumbledore’s hand finds his shoulder and Harry is moving, drifting through the chaos, Dumbledore protective, graceful, dignified.
DUMBLEDORE: Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it? The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. (extending it) Do as I say. Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckled Waitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reaches out and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a tornado. Seconds later...
DUMBLEDORE: Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit their first time.
DUMBLEDORE: Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right?
DUMBLEDORE: Wand out, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE: Lumos... The tip of Dumbledore’s WAND BLAZES. He sweeps the shadows. CALLS OUT. DUMBLEDORE: Horace! Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW
DUMBLEDORE: (nodding to the ceiling) Dragon’s blood.
DUMBLEDORE: Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. (a droll whisper) Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One. Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized. DUMBLEDORE: So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you?
DUMBLEDORE: Take matters into their own hands? Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.
DUMBLEDORE: Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you? Mind?
DUMBLEDORE: That was fun. May I use the loo? As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.
DUMBLEDORE: Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns. Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.
DUMBLEDORE: Indeed they are.
DUMBLEDORE: You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That is why he is returning to Hogwarts. And it is crucial he return... Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the moon. DUMBLEDORE:
DUMBLEDORE: You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE: Both are waiting for you. Dumbledore extends his arm. Mystified, Harry reaches out. As his fingers touch the silk of Dumbledore’s cloak, he...
DUMBLEDORE: The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.
DUMBLEDORE: Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master. Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape. This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns, then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First Years. DUMBLEDORE: Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight. You have a right to know why.
DUMBLEDORE: Today, of course, the world knows him by another name. Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact. Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle. But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you. Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of attention. DUMBLEDORE: Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed. Pip pip!
DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit. Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously. Sits. DUMBLEDORE: So. How are you?
DUMBLEDORE: Enjoying your classes? Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.
DUMBLEDORE: Do you?
DUMBLEDORE: And what of your activities outside the classroom? Do they bring you satisfaction?
DUMBLEDORE: Forgive me, Harry, I...
DUMBLEDORE: ... I was merely curious. (rising) In any event, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers. DUMBLEDORE: What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle. Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age. DUMBLEDORE: This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would... Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises, gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking the surface...
DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps you could give me an example. Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing, depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it.
DUMBLEDORE: How do you do, Tom. Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.
DUMBLEDORE: As you wish. Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time, notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, and
DUMBLEDORE: No. I am a Professor.
DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps they’re right.
DUMBLEDORE: Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Riddle looks up, cocks his head ever-so-slightly. DUMBLEDORE: It’s a school. A school of... magic. Riddle stays looking, but says nothing. DUMBLEDORE: You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t. Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking.
DUMBLEDORE: Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.
DUMBLEDORE: I’m like you, Tom. Different. Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses.
DUMBLEDORE: Take it out. As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE -- the only sound in the now-silent room. DUMBLEDORE: Is there anything in that box you ought not to have? Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE, and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN. DUMBLEDORE: Why did you want these things, Tom?
DUMBLEDORE: Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? (as Riddle nods) I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave your window open tonight. An owl will bring you a message. Read it carefully. Dumbledore starts to exit, when:
DUMBLEDORE: It is unusual. But not unheard of. Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving 11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and...
DUMBLEDORE: Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time? No. Had I... Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle’s fragmented face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore. DUMBLEDORE: Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess which teacher that might be?
DUMBLEDORE: No. I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... (eyeing Harry knowingly) I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry. But I promise. In time you will know everything.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes.
DUMBLEDORE: Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t.
DUMBLEDORE: This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s also a lie. (off Harry’s look) This memory has been tampered with. In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.
DUMBLEDORE: Why indeed. Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve. DUMBLEDORE:
DUMBLEDORE: You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins. Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies them. They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole. DUMBLEDORE: This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore’s hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay.
DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)
DUMBLEDORE: Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?
DUMBLEDORE: Why indeed. Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP.
DUMBLEDORE: This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.
DUMBLEDORE: To whom might I ask?
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended. As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she indicates Ron and Hermione.
DUMBLEDORE: How is he? Horace? Harry shrugs. Dumbledore nods, then tips his hand. A
DUMBLEDORE: (haunted) This is beyond anything I imagined. In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific. I know now... you will see worse. Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.
DUMBLEDORE: Oh he succeeded. And not just once. Think, Harry. He’s just told us.
DUMBLEDORE: They can be anything. The most commonplace of objects. A ring, for example. Or a book... Dumbledore slides open a drawer, removes the RING and Tom Riddle’s battered DIARY.
DUMBLEDORE: It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this -- (holding up the diary)
DUMBLEDORE: Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and... (raising his damaged hand) ... even more difficult to destroy.
DUMBLEDORE: One destroys Voldemort. Harry begins to reach out for the ring...
DUMBLEDORE: True. But magic, especially Dark magic...
DUMBLEDORE: ... leaves traces. Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face. Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow “see” into Harry’s heart. Trepidation -- and recognition -- flicker over his face.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Harry peers into Dumbledore’s eyes. Dumbledore nods. DUMBLEDORE: Once again, I shall ask too much of you.
DUMBLEDORE: Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant. I will not negotiate this with you, Severus. You agreed. There’s nothing more to discuss. Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his back. Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can react -- is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier. Dumbledore turns. Smiles. DUMBLEDORE: Harry. You need a shave, my friend. Harry runs his hand over his face. DUMBLEDORE: At times I forget how much you’ve grown. At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. (smiling) Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I am an old man.
DUMBLEDORE: Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.
DUMBLEDORE: The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry. I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise. But there is a condition: You must obey any command I give you -- without question.
DUMBLEDORE: Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide. Harry nods. * DUMBLEDORE: Should I tell you to run, you will * run. Harry nods. * DUMBLEDORE: And should I tell you to abandon * me and save yourself... Harry’s eyes rise, meet Dumbledore’s. * DUMBLEDORE: * You will do so. * Harry hesitates. DUMBLEDORE: Your word, Harry. Harry debates this internally, then, finally, nods. *
DUMBLEDORE: Take my arm.
DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)
DUMBLEDORE: Being me has its privileges. The WIND GUSTS and Harry reaches out. Dumbledore’s CLOAK
DUMBLEDORE: This is the place. Oh yes, this place has known magic. (closing his eyes) Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty... Dumbledore’s wand stops briefly in its arc and his face registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry. He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the rock. DUMBLEDORE: One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear. But this much is known: the children were damaged. Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his fingers play over the rock... then stop. His eyes open. He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet beads.
DUMBLEDORE: In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much more precious than mine.
DUMBLEDORE: Careful. The water. Harry peers into the lake. It is black as ink.
DUMBLEDORE: It’s there. The only question is how do we get to it?
DUMBLEDORE: Perhaps not.
DUMBLEDORE: If you would, Harry... Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a
DUMBLEDORE: Only recreationally. You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck. Harry looks down into the water, watches a FACE skim by beneath the surface.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes.
DUMBLEDORE: Remember... the water. Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at the source of the GLOW -- a BASIN filled with a
DUMBLEDORE: Oh yes. Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin. Notes the
DUMBLEDORE: It has to be drunk. (as Harry reacts) You remember the condition on which I brought you with me?
DUMBLEDORE: This potion might paralyze me. It might cause me to forget why I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests, Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood?
DUMBLEDORE: Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. (taking the goblet) Your good health, Harry. Dumbledore dips the goblet into the gleaming liquid and brings it to his lips. Drinks deep. Closes his eyes.
DUMBLEDORE: Don’t... don’t make me... Harry eyes Dumbledore’s anguished face, steels himself.
DUMBLEDORE: Nooooooo!!!
DUMBLEDORE: Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
DUMBLEDORE: My fault. It’s all my fault... Harry brings the goblet up once more. Dumbledore drinks. DUMBLEDORE: Too much... I can’t... take it...
DUMBLEDORE: Your word, Harry! Your word!
DUMBLEDORE: Water.
DUMBLEDORE: Water...
DUMBLEDORE: Water! Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it to Dumbledore’s lips... but once again finds it empty. Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air.
DUMBLEDORE: Go... Harry turns, confused. Dumbledore’s hand finds his face. DUMBLEDORE: We have to... go. Harry glances to the boat. Flames lick the prow, darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods.
DUMBLEDORE: No. Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
DUMBLEDORE: (smiling faintly) No, Harry. I do not pray. I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate. Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head, listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his infirmity. DUMBLEDORE: Hide yourself below. And do not speak or show yourself without my permission. No matter what. Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER. DUMBLEDORE: Do as I say, Harry. Harry hesitates. Dumbledore’s eyes blaze... DUMBLEDORE: Trust me. Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below, the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW. DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer? Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about.
DUMBLEDORE: (CONT'D)
DUMBLEDORE: You are not an assassin, Draco.
DUMBLEDORE: Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison. Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I’m curious. When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?
DUMBLEDORE: Then I shall make it easy for you. Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand. * Instantly Malfoy raises his own. *
DUMBLEDORE: Well done, Draco. But I warn you. * Killing is not nearly as easy. *
DUMBLEDORE: You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How?
DUMBLEDORE: That cabinet has been broken for years.
DUMBLEDORE: Ingenious. Let me guess. It has a sister. A twin.
DUMBLEDORE: Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time. Draco looks deep into Dumbledore’s eyes. His hand trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows. Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND... when FOOTSTEPS
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order.
DUMBLEDORE: Severus...
DUMBLEDORE: Severus... please.
