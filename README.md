 Dumbledore AI Chatbot
 
DumbleBot is a personal project I decided pursue in my spare time with the purpose of creating a holistic start to finish product. My projects up till now have been focused on specific skills and largely with the sole purpose of self learning. Being able to learn specific skills and applying them to concepts that personally interest me is how I’m able to stay focused and not feel burnt out. As a data scientist, I’ve gained a spectrum of skills ranging from data visualizations through dashboards, to applied machine learning and deep learning. However, working at my current job has taught me that in addition to the technical side, the presentability of a project as a product is equally important. For this reason I wanted to learn how to use flask, in order to further develop my product semse as a data scientist
